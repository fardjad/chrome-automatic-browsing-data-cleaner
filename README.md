# Automatic Browsing Data Cleaner

## Synopsis

**Automatic Browsing Data Cleaner** is a browser extension for Chromium-compatible
browsers that automatically deletes browsing data at startup and on browser
exit.

The extension is designed to be as unobtrusive as possible.

## Installation

Currently, there are no prebuilt **crx** files available for download.

If you wish to try the extension now, you can clone/download the repository and load it as an unpacked extension. If you so choose, you can also pack the extension manually and install the **crx** file using one of the methods described [here][1].
